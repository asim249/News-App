Includes ~9 news categories like Sports, Technology, Health, etc. Each category is clickable and fetches related news only.

### ⏳ Top Loader on Category Change  
Whenever a user clicks on a category, a top-loading bar appears giving instant feedback while fetching data.

Each article is displayed as a stylish card showing:
- 🖼️ News Image *(fallback static image shown if missing)*
- 📰 Title and Description  
- ✍️ Author Name
